Wish list items:

Check drive permissions so that if a new non-read/writeable drive is plugged in, the DAQ has 
suitable permissions.

Check reported Trimble time to see if it's sensible.  If not, don't try to update system clock.
-> Related, should the system pause until the Trimble reports a sensbile time?

Nice to have - checking of various USB ports in case the Trimble does not go onto /dev/ttyUSB0
