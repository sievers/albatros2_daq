./10-local.rules
----------------
To use the Leo Bodnar, need to drop the 10-local.rules file into
/etc/udev/rules.d/ and then either restart the Pi or reinitialize the
rules with:
  sudo udevadm control --reload
  sudo udevadm trigger
and then the read/write permissions of the LB will be set.

./albatros_daq_utils.py
-----------------------

./albatrosdigitizer.py

./baseband_autorun.py
---------------------
Wrapper script for calling dump_baseband.py and automatically cycling
through different parameters.

./calibrate_snap.py
-------------------
No clue what this script is.

./check_lb.py
-------------
Presumably this code checks the Leo Bodnar.  I don't know, I didn't
write it, and I haven't used it.

./check_trimble.py
------------------
Presumably this code checks the Trimble.  I don't know, I didn't write
it, and I haven't used it.

./config_fpga.py
----------------
Configure the ADCs and FPGA.  There's a new option to specify the
coefficient (for 2- or 4-bit baseband) as either the full number or
log2.  If the latter, prefix the coefficient with a minus sign.

./dump_auto_cross_spectra.py
----------------------------
Deprecated version of dump_spectra.py -- do not use.  We should
probably delete this from the repo at some point.

./dump_baseband.py
------------------
Record baseband with optional autotuning for 4-bit (not implemented
for 2-bit yet).  This script is currently wired to work with the Leo
Bodnar, and the Trimble lines are commented out.

./dump_spectra.py
-----------------
Record directly computed auto- and cross-spectra.  This script is
currently wired to work with the Leo Bodnar, and the Trimble lines are
commented out.

./getbits.py
------------
Convenience script for reporting current # of bits used by the ADC

./lbtools_l.py
--------------
Tools for reading time and GPS coords from Leo Bodnar

./live_spectra_noconfig.py
--------------------------
Barebones live spectrum plotter, also reports FPGA and RPi temperature

./save_adc_snapshot.py
----------------------

./trimble_utils.py
------------------
Tools for reading time and GPS coords from Trimble
