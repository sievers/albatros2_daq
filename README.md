Wish list items:

Check drive permissions so that if a new non-read/writeable drive is plugged in, the DAQ has suitable permissions.
Check reported Trimble time to see if it's sensible.  If not, don't try to update system clock.
   Related, should the system pause until the Trimble reports a sensbile time?
Nice to have - checking of various USB ports in case the Trimble does not go onto /dev/ttyUSB0
